# About the project

This is a course about statistics with open source tools: R, RStudio, and so on.

This course is massive!

Every week there will be a submission with a deadline on the following Sunday at 23:55.
Late submissions will not be accepted.

After that, three other projects will be assigned for peer review.
The deadline for the peer reviews is Wednesday the same week at 23:55.

The exercises and the peer reviews are all that is required for this course.
