# Regression and model validation

Load the wrangled data and take a look at it.
```{r}
learning2014 <- read.table("data/learning2014.tsv", sep = "\t")
str(learning2014)
```

Plot the data.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# initialize plot with data and aesthetic mapping
p1 <- ggplot(learning2014, aes(x = attitude, y = points, col = gender))

# define the visualization type (points)
p2 <- p1 + geom_point()

# add a regression line
p3 <- p2 + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# add a main title and draw the plot
p4 <- p3 + ggtitle("Student's attitude versus exam points")

# draw the plot
p4
```
